Throughout the past few years, I've slowly accumulated a variety of projects. This website was built to catalog and share the projects I've undertaken, complete or not. 


I've experimented with a range of different things, including CAD modelling and 3D printing, embedded programming, and even a little bit of reverse engineering.
Most of these things were just a means to an end, but nonetheless very educational. This website itself - built using jekyll - was a new experience for me!


I hope you can learn a thing or two from my past experiences too, and feel free to take a look around and reach out of any of the projects speak to you!
